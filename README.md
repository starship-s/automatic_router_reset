# automatic_router_reset

I was having trouble with my router locking up about once a day, with no response when trying to access the GUI interface.
This is a simple script to reboot a DD-WRT router automatically using SSH when it loses connection, eliminating the need to powercycle it manually.

Runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 for constant low-cost monitoring.
